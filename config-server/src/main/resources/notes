📖 What does Config Server do?
✔️ It connects to the Config Repo (Git folder or cloud GitHub repo)
✔️ Fetches config files for a microservice when that service starts
✔️ Serves config dynamically to services via HTTP endpoint


For example:
👉 When authservice starts, it sends a request:

GET http://localhost:8085/authservice/default

And Config Server responds with config for authservice from the Config Repo.


------------------------
👉 Config Repo → stores config files
👉 Config Server → serves those configs to services
👉 Microservices → fetch config from Config Server at startup
